# ppLTLTT
A tool for converting pure-past LTL formulae to temporal testers.

## Installation instructions:
[ghc](https://www.haskell.org/ghc/) and [Cabal](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) are required.  
After having installed ghc and Cabal and cloned the repository, execute the command `cabal install` from the root directory (where the .cabal file is located).

## Usage instructions:
Given a ppLTL formula, **ppLTLTT** outputs a temporal tester in Hanoi Omega-Automata format. A [description](http://adl.github.io/hoaf/) of this format is available.

### Options
Available options:
```
  -o,--output FILENAME              File to output result to  
  -m,--monitor-variable IDENTIFIER  Monitor variable (default: "z")  
  -f,--formula FORMULA              Formula to process  
  -F,--file FILE                    File to process  
  -h,--help                         Show this help text
```

### Syntax of ppLTL formulae
The formula parser for **ppLTLTT** is the same as that used by **pltl2tgba**, which is written to resemble Spot's formula parser as closely as possible in terms of operator precedence and associativity.
See the following [documentation](https://spot.lre.epita.fr/tl.pdf) for a description. **ppLTLTT** supports the following Boolean operators:

| Symbol | Alternatives | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| ! | ~ | Negation
| & | &&, /\\ | Conjunction |
| \| | \|\|, \\/ | Disjunction
| -> | -->, => | Implication
| <-> | <-->, <=> | Equivalence
| ^ | xor | Exclusive disjunction |

Additionally, the following temporal operators are supported:

| Symbol | Alternatives | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| H | [~] | Historically |
| O | <~> | Once |
| Y | (~) | Yesterday |
| T | | Weak Yesterday |
| S | | Since |
| Z | | Weak Since |

### Example of usage

Assuming that the **ppLTLTT** executable is on the path, a temporal tester for the formula "p <-> Y q" with monitor variable "t" is generated by calling **ppLTLTT** as follows:
```
ppLTLTT -m 't' -f 'p <-> Y q'
```
This will give the following output:
```
HOA: v1
Start: 0
acc-name: all
Acceptance: 1 t
AP: 3 "t" "p" "q"
